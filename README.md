# CS330
This repository contains my final project for CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. It includes a completed 3D scene showcasing lighting, textures, camera controls, and object transformations, along with a Design Decisions document and reflection journal. This project demonstrates my skills in OpenGL, software design, and graphics programming.

## Reflection
### How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking complex requirements into manageable, modular components. I prioritize planning, outlining core functionality, and visualizing the system before diving into development. Tools like sketches, flow diagrams, and pseudocode help me structure the project’s architecture early.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project sharpened my skills in 3D scene composition, material and lighting design, and camera perspective planning. I learned to balance realism and performance while creating a visually engaging and interactive 3D scene.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process: I began with a concept sketch, identified the necessary 3D objects, and determined appropriate lighting and textures. I then used milestones to progressively refine each element, from basic object placement to camera control and lighting optimization.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modular and milestone-based approach allows for easy testing, scaling, and visual improvements. I can apply this in future graphics work or UI/UX development, where staged visual feedback is key to polishing a product.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I typically start by setting up a clean development environment and then build functionality in incremental steps. I write reusable functions and test regularly, making sure each element works before layering on complexity.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I incorporated shader management, texture application, lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular), and modular code organization to separate camera, input, and object transformation logic. I also used glm transformations extensively.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial. I consistently tested and revised object placements, lighting effects, and camera interactions. Each milestone allowed me to improve visual fidelity and code efficiency based on prior feedback and results.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Initially, I focused on getting objects to render, but by the final milestone, I was implementing advanced features like real-time lighting and camera movement. My coding style became more modular and abstracted, making it easier to expand and maintain the project.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science empowers me to build systems that solve real-world problems. It opens doors to careers in software engineering, game development, and AI, helping me combine creativity with problem-solving.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They taught me about spatial reasoning, matrix math, and rendering pipelines—all foundational for advanced topics in game development, simulations, and AR/VR environments.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This experience enhances my qualifications for roles in front-end development, game design, simulation software, and 3D visualization tools. Understanding how to efficiently create and control 3D environments will be a significant asset in the tech industry.
